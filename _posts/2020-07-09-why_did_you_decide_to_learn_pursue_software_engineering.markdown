**Is coding even for me?**

I've always been interested in computers, and I am mostly on my computer all day (If I'm not at work, that is). A friend of mine just playfully brought up, "Why don't you try coding? Since you are always on your computer anyways." I took that comment seriously and tried a few free coding lessons online before I actually applied, of course. It got me to be very intrigued about the whole process of how codes are made, and how it all creates things coders/programmers are wanting to create. It took me a while to actually decide on this path, and clicking the *apply* button on Flat Iron's application. I wasn't sure if coding was for ME; if I am even able to comprehend what even codes are, what coding is, if I even belong in this field!

**Researching phase**

I did a little research before I stumbled upon Flat Iron; I read reviews about Flat Iron, and saw a lot of positive reviews. I asked my other coding friends and acquaintances about Flat Iron, they recommended the school and heard great things about them. I asked my coding friend who also went to a bootcamp at UW about her experience. After many research was done, I decided to finally click the *apply* button... "Here goes nothing!" After scheduling an interview with one of the account executives, I also asked a whole bunch of questions. (That's right, I'm one of those annoying people who asks a lot of questions)! I was finally convinced that this path was for me. It was a big step forward for me, and I am glad that I took that step!

**My thoughts after starting the program**

I was really nervous and excited the week of the program! And also really confused with *everything*. This is also my first coding experience, so I also do not understand some concepts and words, but the TC's and classmates always helped guide me whenever I needed help, which I really appreciate! All I know is, coding isn't easy; I never thought it was, and will probably struggle for a bit. But the rewarding experience when I do get it is the *best* and I wouldn't trade it for anything else. I'm glad I decided to pursue this path, this career!
