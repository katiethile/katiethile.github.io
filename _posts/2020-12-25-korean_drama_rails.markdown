*How did I feel initially beginning this project?*
Thought it wouldn't be so bad, since it should be similar to sinata... boy was a wrong! I underestimated rails. Never underestimate something you've never done!


*What was the most challenging part aobut this project overall?*

Honestly, this project was stressful overall. Sometimes a code would work, then all of a sudden it would break. But the most challenging part was figuring out the paths to redirect all of the actions. But, after working on this project, really made me learn about rails overall, which was the cool part. I guess you really do learn as you go right? Also, thinking what the associations are was the hard part as well, for the models. 

*What was the most fun part of doing the project?*

The fun part was the css styling for me! It's always fun to make what you're creating look the best as you want it to! It was also cool to learn how to do third party log in, as we all used third party logins before in our lives. I used the facebook third party login, as i use it in my everyday life. 

*Why did I pick korean dramas as my topic?*

Korean dramas and K-pop in general has been a part of my life since as long as I can remember; maybe since 2009? It'll always have a place in my heart! I love it so much that I know phrases here and there, without needing subtitles to understand! Plus their sense of humour is what draws me in. 

*What did I learn as a result of doing this  project?*

I learned a whole lot of stuff! How to properly redirect my routes, how to build nested routes, learning more about the importance of pry as usual, and of course, how awesome it all is once everything starts working the way you pictured it to be!

*In conclusion*

When doing a project, pick a topic that you would enjoy doing/working with, as it will give you more motivation to keep at it and not quit!
