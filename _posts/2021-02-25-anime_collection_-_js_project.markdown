**How Was I Feeling Before Starting**
Before beginning the project, I was really nervous and confused. Javascript in general was really different compared to what I've been learning so far, which was mostly ruby and rails related stuff. Javascipt is still really confusing, but I think that as I keep doing labs and projects related to it, I get the grasp of it more, slowly. 

**How Was The Process?**
I think all in all, if you enjoy the topic you're doing your project on, then you are more interested/motivated in doing the project. So, I picked a topic which I've been really into lately, due to the pandemic, anime! It really helped me with quarantine and whatnot. Also, watching videos and seeing others' exanples of the projects really helped quite a bit with the process of the project. Talking and working with other coding peers also helped me a lot. 

**What Was Challenging?**
The most challenging part for me was figuring out the async functions and the delete function. Where to direct the path for the delete function was what got me confused. This whole JS project is really different compared to rails/sinatra; for example, we open the broswer differently, we still use the rails server but just to see data being passed through and whatnot but not the actual view. Instead of pry, we use th debugger to help us debug stuff. And even then, it is not really specfic with the errors as with pry/ruby. 

**In Conclusion**
I felt like working wih the backend/rails stuff at first that I forgot about the materials I learned from the past mod, but after watching videos and studying up on it, it came back to me. It was just a bit confusing thinking that the views is not within rails but wihin JS at first. It was kind of fun to play around with a little of CSS even though I'm not the best at it; I do enjoy a simple but eye-catching project. Overall, It was a good experience!
