**How did I feel initially, before starting the sinatra project? 

*ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED*. Ha! I said it. I'm not the fastest learner, and I cannot say that even after doing this project, I understand sinatra 100%, but I somehow got to be able to finish it. Before actually starting this project, I had absolutely no clue what this project was to be consisted of. Until I got to the Fwitter lab! That lab took me a while to figure it out, but in the end, it really help a bit with building my actual project, and I'm glad I was introduced to this lab. 

**The process**

I got to say, the corneal gem was so helpful and I'm glad it exists! It really helped me set up my project, no joke. Everything went smoothly, from the users and animes models, to the migrations of the tables, and the users controllers; what really took me a longer time to figure out and connect each other is the views of the animes and animes controller, mainly the edit and index. And what really is tricky is figuring out the ruotes nd how each redirects connects to one another, and if each redirect makes sense. It's also really fun seeing it being built out one by one, and it slowly being the application you wanted it to be. What's really helpfu l is using both binding.pry and shotgun.

**How I felt at the end**

It was fun to be able to create your very one unique application, of the thing that you wanted to keep track of! Mine was user keeping track of what anime they watch/are watching, with the watch status and rating. But I thought the most fun part was styling the application with different background colors, adding images, aligning the app, etc. Overall, I'm still learning how this all works, and I'm glad I got to build this prohect!
