**How I felt about the project at the beginning**

Reading about this project in general made me super nervous and confused for the most part. I had literally no idea at all how to start anything; even how to start the project set up. Thankfully that within the project resources, the Eden Project, and also the study group video, also showed me how to set up my project within the sandbox on IDE, since I did not have my local environment set up. It was really helpful. After that, it also took me a bit to think of a topic and how I would input that into an app, and what I would want that app to do with my topic. After looking at the World's Best Restaurants for ideas and guide, I decided on the top ten anime of all time as a topic; and with that topic, I decided to show the user the synopsis and reviews on the anime that the user is interested in at the moment. So, after knowing what I wanted my app to do and the topic, I used many video and other resources listed. 

**The process**

Honestly, the hardest part of this project was getting everything to talk to each other and work together. Oh, and also scraping was confusing for me. It still is. But I think through this project, it helped me to learn how to scrape better,  understand the concept of it better and how it works. I guess what people say is true; you got to actually do the work to understand the work. I started working on the CLI class first, getting my methods sorted out and what I want my user inputs to be first before I started working on my scraper class and anime class. Then I just started to write the simple codes for the anime class like the attr_accessors, initializing the variables, and also the @@all method. I would jump back and forth between all classes, using pry a lot to make sure everything was working correctly. Before this project, I never really liked to use pry, because I didn't get how to use it, but after starting this project, I can't live without using pry now! It's such a useful tool to use, and I'm glad I got to learn how to use it better! 

**How I feel after completing the project**

It felt so great to see that my project was how I wanted it to turn out like; when you enter the app, the app will welcome you to the site. After that, it'll list the top 10 anime and their rankings. User will choose which anime they're interested in to get more info on, which after choosing, will display both the anime synopsis and reviews. I've always loved anime, so throughout this project, I felt so excited seeing this being created in front of my eyes. It was pretty dreadful and pretty confusing at first, but in the end, it'll leave you feeling rewarded!
